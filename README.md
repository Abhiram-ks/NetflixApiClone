Netflix Clone â€“ BLoC/Cubit

- Project Overview:
This project is a Netflix-style movie streaming UI clone built using Flutter with BLoC/Cubit for state management. The app integrates with the TMDB (The Movie Database) REST API to fetch and display trending, top-rated, and upcoming movies. It's designed to help understand and implement BLoC architecture effectively while maintaining a clean and optimized mobile UI.

The application uses Dio (or http) for network calls and features structured UI sections like movie categories, search functionality, movie detail pages, and more. It serves as a great learning project for mastering asynchronous data handling, state transitions, and clean UI composition using Flutter.

- Key Features(ðŸ”‘): 
* Browse Movies by Categories (Trending, Top Rated, Upcoming, etc.)
* Search Functionality with real-time results
* Detailed Movie Pages with posters, overviews, and ratings
* Asynchronous Data Handling using Dio and BLoC
* Navigation & Routing for smooth transitions
* Dependency Injection (if used) for better testability and modularity
